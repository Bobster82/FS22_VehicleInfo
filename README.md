This mod is made by me from scratch with snippets/looks from some other mods. It was only meant for personal use,<br>
    &nbsp; but upon request I share this with you. Created only for single player.</br>
I got my inspiration from several mods, credits to: HappyLooser (VehicleInspector), sperrgebiet (VehicleExplorer), <br>
    &nbsp; CoursePlay Dev team (CoursePlay), AutoDrive Dev team (AutoDrive).</br>
